/* 1. Implement a function findBin(n), which will generate binary numbers from 1 to n in the form of a string using a queue. An illustration is also provided for your understanding.
 */

/* 2. You have to implement the minStack class, which will have a min() function. Whenever min() is called, the minimum value of the stack is returned in O(1) time. The element is not popped from the stack; its value is simply returned.
